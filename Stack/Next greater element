class Solution:
    # Function to find the next greater element for each element of the array.
    def nextLargerElement(self, arr):
        stack =[]
        res= [-1]*len(arr)
        for i in range(len(arr)-1 , -1 , -1):
            while stack and stack[-1] <= arr[i]:
                stack.pop()
            if stack:
                res[i] =stack[-1]
            stack.append(arr[i])
        return res

Intution:
=> traverse it from back it i find smaller element
=> if i find that element on top it greater  i will pop until i find smaller element and that will be next smaller element
arr = [1, 3, 2, 4]
res = [-1, -1, -1 , -1]
start with 4 so stack if empty res so that element is -1
4 is added to stack 
2 comes now and 2 is less than top of stack so directly assgn top to smallest next element
so it just added to stack
3 comes now it greater than stacks top so start poping it becomes smaller than assign top element
