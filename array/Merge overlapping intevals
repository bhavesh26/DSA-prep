class Solution:
    def merge(self, intervals: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:
        intervals.sort(key = lambda x: x[0])
        ans=[intervals[0]]
        for i in range(1, len(intervals)):
            pre = ans[-1]
            curr = intervals[i]
            if(curr[0] <=pre[1]):
                pre[1] = max(pre[1] , curr[1])
            else:
                ans.append(curr)
        return ans

inte :
=> sort based on 0th index
=> comapre it and store it

where i needed to help:
=> how to compute and take it from two places 
this was solved by always taking it from ans and then comparing it
